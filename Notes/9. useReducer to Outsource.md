# useReducer

-   it is a function that we create

-   it has an initial object state

-   updated like Redux

```
const httpReducer = (curHttpState, action) => {
	switch (action.type) {
		case "RES":
			return { loading: false, ...curHttpState };

		case "CLEAR":
			return { ...curHttpState, error: null };

		case "SEND":
			return { loading: true, error: null };

		case "ERROR":
			return { error: action.error, loading: false };

		default:
			throw new Error("should not get here...");
	}
};

const [httpState, dispatchHttp] = useReducer(httpReducer, {
    loading: false,
    error: null,
});
```

-   `dispatch` to get the actions going and passed into the reducer!

-   it is very similar to Redux!

---

Struture of `useReducer`
`const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, intialState)`

dispatch -> reducer

-   the dispatch _is_ related to the reducer.

---

0. create the interface for how you want the object / structure to look like

-   one action at the moment, just create an interface with ALL actions later on or a UNION operator!!

1. create the reducer

-   `export const reducer = (state: IAppStateValue, action: AddToCartAction) => {};`

-   Note: `{ type: 'SOME_TYPE' }`: the **`action`** is similar to **`Redux`**, used in the interface

2. move the `onAddToCart` function into the case `"ADD_TO_CART"`

-   fix whatever needed to be fixed when moved over to `AppState.tsx`

3. organizing AppState

-   rename `setState` to `dispatch`
-   change the `value={}` type to the `dispatch type` instead of the `setState type` when creating the context
-   changed the name for the custom hook from `useSetState` to `useStateDispatch`
