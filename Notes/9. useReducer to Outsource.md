# useReducer

-   it is a function that we create

-   it has an initial object state

-   updated like Redux

```
const httpReducer = (curHttpState, action) => {
	switch (action.type) {
		case "RES":
			return { loading: false, ...curHttpState };

		case "CLEAR":
			return { ...curHttpState, error: null };

		case "SEND":
			return { loading: true, error: null };

		case "ERROR":
			return { error: action.error, loading: false };

		default:
			throw new Error("should not get here...");
	}
};

const [httpState, dispatchHttp] = useReducer(httpReducer, {
    loading: false,
    error: null,
});
```

-   `dispatch` to get the actions going and passed into the reducer!

-   it is very similar to Redux!

Struture of `useReducer`
`const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, intialState)`
