# Adding to code

1. go to file, `webpack.config.js`

-   add `devtool: "eval-source-map"`

2. for production, create `webpack.config.prod.js` file

-   `devtool: "none"`

-   `"source-map"` | bad choice, will show source code to visitors

-   `"hidden-source-map"` | does not show source map, for error reporting only, not good to deploy to the webserver, remove it when deploying!

-   `"nopsources-source-map"` | shows the filename and structures but not the source code!

# Why add Source Maps?

-   If `runtime error` occurs, usually an error in line `n` will display in the browser ( which is expected ), however since the browser executes JS, it will not reflect the same line in our original TS file!

    -   it will only tell the error RELATIVE of the `JS` file, **NOT** the `TS` file, not good.

    -   ex. error on chrome dev tool says error on `line 10`, in our original file, the error is in `line 5`

# Solution?

**Auto generate a source map so it reflects the correct line for the error!**

Use the `devtool` option from `Webpack`
[https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/](Devtool)

-   `SourceMapDevToolPlugin`: more fine grained config

-   In the current project, we will use

    -   `eval-source-map`

Notes:

-   avoid `any` keyword as much as you can

-   How TS executes into the brower.
    `TS` => `JS` => `browser`
