| Title                                   | NOtes                                                                                                                           |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0a - cheat sheet                        | cheat sheet on how to write Components for `React` in TS                                                                        |
| 0b - from scratch                       | setting up from scratch! `npm`,`webpack.config.js`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `loaders`                                  |
| 1 - adding react deps                   | adding `React` deps! Downloading `presets` and adding some props the config files listed above                                  |
| 2 - adding source map                   | `Source Mapping` for correct error line during run time error!                                                                  |
| 3 - create FN component                 | Creating the first `Function Component`! `interface`, creating an interface per object                                          |
| 4 - add CSS Modules                     | `FoodCard.tsx`, adding `CSS Modules` in the config files and other `CSS loaders`, `custom.d.ts`, `typescript-plugin-css-module` |
| 5 - adding SVGs                         | `pizza.svg`, adding `SVG presets`! Add definition in `custom.d.ts`, configure in config files!                                  |
| 6 - create class component              | `Props, State` interface!, also added `react-icons` for icon usage!                                                             |
| 7 - handling Event Handler              | Grabbing the event handle types if needed, `event.target.value` will have a type of                                             |
| 8 - Context API                         | `createContext`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, custom hook                                                                        |
| 9 - useReducer                          | `useReducer` is coded up! `state` and `dispatch` is created and passed as values                                                |
| 10 - useEffect, localStorage            | added notes on `useEffect` and it's life cycle, setting and getting itmes in local storage                                      |
| 11 - create simple HoC and advanced HoC | similar code to `FoodCard.tsx`, nothing really changed, Advanced HoC is easy to follow, thankfully!                             |
| 12 - with Render Props                  | Tbh... not needed.                                                                                                              |
| 13 - Original DOM Events                | Tbh... bad practice... ok implementation but don't manipulate DOM in React                                                      |

# Files

App.tsx

-   A FN component
-   `<Toolbar />` - shows the nav bar
-   `<PizzaSVG />` - a pizza picture
-   `<Cart />` - shows the button and the menu list
-   `<SpecialOffer />` - show a differently styled food card
-   `<FoodCard />` - shows the food card

<br>

---

Toolbar.tsx

-   expects a `navigations` prop of type `Navigation[]` from parent component
-   just maps out the `links`

<br>

---

FoodCard.tsx

-   imports interfaces, HoC components
-   a FN component
-   contains a function that will add an object to the array in the reducer of AppState.tsx, via dispatch action! onAddToCart is from the HoC that gets the function from AppState.tsx

<br>

---

Cart.tsx

-   class component, so create Props and State interfaces
-   containes a private variable for a `ref` ( the usage does not portray good practices! take this with a grain of salt, but take away that you can use private variables! )
-   two functions that closes or opens the menu, menu shows list of Pizzas
-   the pizza information is grabbed from the context API, and mapped out in the div!

<br>

---

AppState.tsx

-   state management via useReducer ( created interfaces for Actions! contains two cases, INIT CART and ADD TO CART)
-   context API, useContext, createContext
-   custom hook to check if dispatch is undefined or has a valid function
-   a FN component
-   uses useEffect to interact with local storage, that sets and gets the reducer data to local storage for persistent information, reloads will not wipe out information!
-   `.Provider` enable the contexts to be filled with data / values!

<br>

---

pizzas.json

-   an array of objects

---

<br>

withAddToCart.tsx

-   a FN component
-   by extending the withAddToCartProps to OriginalProps, the object passed in should include onAddToCart function!
-   `function withAddToCart<OriginalProps extends withAddToCartProps>`, the component that will be passed should include `onAddToCart` function
-   created my own function that uses the HoC instead of passing down the onAddToCart function
-   discoverd this hack: `const foodVariable = (props as never) as FoodVariable`, I wonder if it is an anti-pattern!

---

<br>

customDefinitions.d.ts

-   declaring module syntax and how they should be handled

---

<br>

index.tsx

```
ReactDOM.render(
    <AppStateContext>
        <App />
    </AppStateContext>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

-   Renders the App

---

<br>

types.ts

-   where you can export the different type of interfaces, keep things neat and outsourced so nothing looks BLOATED.
