# Event Handlers

Notes:

-   `event` or `e` is given automatically with event handlers, you use a lot with `e.target.value` | `e.target.name` with input fields etc!

    -   that being said, the `e` variable is given as a SYNTETHIC event that is rendered by React, **NOT** the original event from the HTML item

-   This is the start to EXPLICITLY grab the `type` for events! ex. `React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<IAppStateValue>>`

-   TS Practices, the types on events ( onChange, onClick, etc.) are the types in the function's argument, check `toggleIsOpen` function, and check what type the event is!

---

1. check the type of the event object and copy and paste it

    - hover over `onClick`
    - copy the type of the event
    - paste it as the type of the argument

2. If you want, make it an optional argument by adding a `?`!

3. important properties of `e` property

-   `e.target`: the element in which the event occurs

-   `e.currentTarget`: the element where the event handler is attached to

4. Look at `((event.target as HTMLElement).nodeName === "BUTTON")`

-   looks daunting, but it says, if the target is an HTML element and the name of the node is button then do something

-   `.nodeName`, the target item ( which is the node ), and its name
