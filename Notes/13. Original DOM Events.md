# Handling DOM Events

Handling the DOM is generally bad practice

Asked Dmytro about this!

-   **` Nothing really good here.`**

---

Anyways, we'll get the answer from him so just add the code he's explaining!

1. In Cart.tsx

-   add private variable: `#containerRef`

-   `Node` is a basic type that describes any DOM Node | DOM consists of Nodes | can refer to different things like `text`, `comments`, etc

    -   `Node`
        -   `HTMLElement`
        -   `HTMLDivElement`
        -   examples are subsets of `Node`
