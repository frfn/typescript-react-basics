# Function Components

Note:

-   Going deep in the rabbit hole, visited the `interface Renderer` for `ReactDOM.render()`: many overloaded functions.

    -   these functions can take many different arguments

    -   you can hover over `.render()` to see what function TypeScript | React chose!

---

1. Grabbed `pizzas.json` from udemy

-   just an array of objects

2. TS doesnt know how to import JSON files

-   in `tsconfig.json`

    -   **enable** `"resolveJsonModule": true`

    -   if _`resolveJsonModule`_ is enabled,

        -   `"moduleResolution": "Node`

    -   TS will now know what the JSON file consists of

3. create a TS Functional Component

-   `Pizza.tsx`

---

## Props

-   when components have `props`, we should describe them like we did in Pizza.tsx

-   `Component: React.FC` - `<P = {}>` are the props

    -   `React.FC` === `React.FunctionComponent`

-   There is a `workflow` for `interfaces` in React for Props!

    -   1. the name of the prop that will be passed in to argument!
    -   2. what props you're expecting

## Quiz Example

-   use `interface` to describe `objects`
-   use `aliases` to create types based on other types using `intersection` | `union` | `generics`

```
const Product: React.FC = ({title, price}) => {
    return <li>{title} - {price}</li>;
};
```

-   using `types` AND `interfaces`
    -   they can be great if used like this!

```
interface UserProps {
    title: string,
    price: number
}

type WithUserProps<P extends object> = P & UserProps;
type MyProps = WithUserProps<{skills: string[]}>;

let myProps: MyProps = {
    title: "Software Engineer",
    price: 80000,
    skills: ["TypeScript", "React"]
}
```
