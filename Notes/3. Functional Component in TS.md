# Function Components

Note:

-   Going deep in the rabbit hole, visited the `interface Renderer` for `ReactDOM.render()`: many overloaded functions.

    -   these functions can take many different arguments

    -   you can hover over `.render()` to see what function TypeScript | React chose!

---

1. Grabbed `pizzas.json` from udemy

-   just an array of objects

2. TS doesnt know how to import JSON files

-   in `tsconfig.json`

    -   **enable** `"resolveJsonModule": true`

    -   if _`resolveJsonModule`_ is enabled,

        -   `"moduleResolution": "Node`

    -   TS will now know what the JSON file consists of

3. create a TS Functional Component

-   `Pizza.tsx`

---

## Props

-   when components have `props`, we should describe them like we did in Pizza.tsx

-   `Component: React.FC` - `<P = {}>` are the props

    -   `React.FC` === `React.FunctionComponent`

-   There is a `workflow` for `interfaces` in React for Props!

    -   1. the name of the props that will be passed in to argument of the function component!

    -   2. if those props is an object that contain more props, write out the interface for that as well

    -   kind of looks like a tree, keep going down till props are primitive types!

    ```
                {pizza, id, title}
               /         |        \
    {toping: string,    :number     :string
     size: string }
    ```

## Quiz Example

-   use `interface` to describe `objects`
-   use `aliases` to create types based on other types using `intersection` | `union` | `generics`

```
const Product: React.FC = ({title, price}) => {
    return <li>{title} - {price}</li>;
};
```

-   using `types` AND `interfaces`
    -   they can be great if used like this!

```
interface UserProps {
    title: string,
    price: number
}

type WithUserProps<P extends object> = P & UserProps;
type MyProps = WithUserProps<{skills: string[]}>;

let myProps: MyProps = {
    title: "Software Engineer",
    price: 80000,
    skills: ["TypeScript", "React"]
}
```

# Notes for myself:

```
interface FunctionComponent<P extends object> {
	(someArg: P): void;
}

const coolFunction: FunctionComponent<Props> = (someArg: Props): void => {
	console.log(someArg);
};

const coolPContent: Pizza = {
	id: 1, // used for key
	name: "string",
	description: "fadsf",
	price: 2,
};

const coolP: Props = {
	pizza: coolPContent,
};

coolFunction(coolPContent);
```
