# Context API and React Hooks useState ( use Redux, that's your game!)

Notes:

-   Check older projects you've already wondered about this multiple times

1. to create, `.createContext()`

2. You must use `<NameOfContext.Provider value={this.state.name}> {children} </NameOfContext.Provider>`

-   `.Provider` must be used, either for Functional or Class based, you MUST have this so you can **`set`** the value for the function or variable!

3. To use:

For Function Component:

-   `useContext()`

For Class Component:

-   `static contextType` are reserved and React will know that this is a Context

-   `this.context.varName` is how the information is accessed

```
static contextType = MyContext;
    render() {
        let value = this.context.value;
        /* render something based on the value */
    }
```

---

1. create `/context` folder

2. create `context` file

-   created an `interface` that is an object, that has cart as a key, and it contains an item key, that holds an array of objects

3. New learn, no need to make type of an `objectName[]`!

-   you can one line: `items: { name: string; price: number } []; `

    -   note the `[]` at the end of the statement

4. Create the component

-   `useState` to create a state! It is a generic as well which is good to know because by having a structure to the state, it can be type safe!

-   For context providers, you must use `value` key word to pass information to the context

-   workflow contains a step or two more for type safing ( adding the `interface` | creating a variable that holds an `object` )

5. `type React.FC<P = {}> = React.FunctionComponent<P>`

-   argument, by default is an object, and usually, `children` and `props` ARE objects

-   no need to pass an argument for the `generics` of `React.FC` since it takes in `{}` by default
