# Context API and React Hooks useState ( use Redux, that's your game!)

Notes:

-   Check older projects you've already wondered about this multiple times

1. to create a context, `.createContext()`

2. You must use `<NameOfContext.Provider value={this.state.name}> {children} </NameOfContext.Provider>`

-   `.Provider` must be used, either for Functional or Class based, you **MUST** have this so you can **`set`** the value for the function or variable!

3. To use:

For **Function** Component:

-   `useContext()`

For **Class** Component:

-   `static contextType` are **reserved key words** and React will know that this is a **Context**

-   `this.context.varName` is how the information is accessed

```
static contextType = MyContext;
    render() {
        let value = this.context.value;
        /* render something based on the value */
    }
```

---

1. create `/context` folder

2. create `context` file

-   created an `interface` that is an object, that has cart as a key, and it contains an item key, that holds an array of objects

3. **New learn**

-   you can one line: `items: { name: string; price: number } []; `

    -   note the `[]` at the end of the statement

    -   different from what I did, which is to create a new type, ex. `type Navigations = Navigation[];`

4. Create the component

-   `useState` to manage state! `useState` is a **`generic`** as well, which is good to know because by having a structure to the state, it can be type safe!

-   For context providers, you must use `value` key word to pass information to the context

-   workflow contains a step or two more for type safing ( adding the `interface` | creating a variable that holds an `object` )

5. `type React.FC<P = {}> = React.FunctionComponent<P>`

-   argument, by default is an object, and usually, `children` and `props` ARE objects

-   no need to pass an argument for the `generics` of `React.FC` since it takes in `{}` by default

6. create another `context` to optimize performance ( so it does **`NOT`** rerender the whole component since that is what setState does )

-   different implementation from normal React! In ReactJS, you can just pass in as is an object, by doing, it does rerender the whole component, so you may lose performance

```
value={{cart: cart, setCart: setCart}}
```

-   `createContext` is a generic, in the implementation it includes `| undefined` since the `createContext` variable can be `undefined` or have a `value` for the `setState` context

7. Putting the information in their respective component so we don't have to `prop` chain!

-   `cart` object & `setCart` function from the Context API are in the component they need to be in

8. Creating a basic **`custom hook`**, very easy!

-   just take a look in `AppState.tsx`

-   this custom hook just checks to see if setState is **`undefined`** or not

    -   if it is, throw an error

    -   in the AppState.tsx, useSetState is just a structure, and the value (setState) is given when **USED** in the component because it is wrapped with the provider, giving the value to the context

-   it does not belong in the `if` statement anymore in `FoodCard.tsx`

9. Go through the logic of adding to quantity, that was a great debug and walkthrough moment, give yourself a pat on the back because you thoroughly understand it.
