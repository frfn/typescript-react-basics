1. In `App.tsx`

-   created an `interface` for my Navigation object

-   created a `type` for an array of Navigation objects

-   created a `navLinks` array with two objects!

2. Created `Toolbar.tsx` component

-   imported to be used in `App.tsx`

-   created an `interface` and `type` for the props!

-   `map()` out the links inside a `<li>` inside a `<ul>`

3. Created the `Toolbar.module.css`

-   just the usual toolbar css, nothing too crazy!
