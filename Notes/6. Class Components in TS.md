# Class Components

Notes:

-   `React.Component` takes in 3 arguments

    -   `props`
    -   `state`
    -   some custom data from `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` method, such as scroll position, you can learn this some time after!

-   `state` vs `constructor state` - just state is syntactic sugar for constructor state, be aware that older React may not support that syntax! - if to use `constructor state`, set state should be `this.state = {}` instead of just `state = {}`

-   Accessing props and state
    -   `this.props.varName`
    -   `this.state.varName`

CSS Notes:

-   flex takes up 100% of width unless you specify alignment | justification

---

1. Create basic class component structure

2. Create the interfaces for `props` & `state`

    - `isOpen: boolean` is the state, probably used for a UI state

    ```
    ex. sideDrawerState

    const [sideDrawerState, setSideDrawerState] = useState(false);

    const sideDrawerToggle = () => {
    	setSideDrawerState((prevState) => {
    		return !prevState;
    	});
    };
    ```

3. Worked on the CSS file for Cart in `Cart.module.css`

-   practicing my flex CSS and researched a little!

4. `npm i -S react-icons`

-   react icons!
